        <Highlight>Eat where Leh?</Highlight> is a web-based platform designed to help users quickly find dining options by filtering based on cuisine, budget, and proximity to shopping malls. Tailored for diverse dining needs—whether it's a date, group outing, or solo meal—it simplifies the decision-making process.
        <br />This is my ongoing personal project, initially built with JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and PHP, and is currently being transitioned to React.
